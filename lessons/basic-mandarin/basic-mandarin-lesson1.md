# Beginner Chinese Lesson (15 Minutes)

## Section 1: What Is Chinese? (2 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand what Mandarin Chinese is and where it is spoken.

**Topic**  
Chinese usually refers to Mandarin, the most widely spoken language in the world. Mandarin is spoken in mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore, and by Chinese communities worldwide. Mandarin uses tones, meaning the pitch of your voice can change the meaning of a word.  

Mandarin is written using **characters** instead of an alphabet. Each character represents a meaning and often a syllable, not a sound like letters in English. There are **tens of thousands of Chinese characters** in total, but most native speakers use about **3,000–4,000 characters** in everyday reading.

**Check Question:**  
Approximately how many Chinese characters does a native Mandarin speaker need to read daily text?
