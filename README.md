reachy-mini-lessongraph is a LangGraph-orchestrated, multi agent tutoring pipeline for Reachy Mini. It ingests lesson PDFs, builds a retrieval index (RAG), generates structured 15 minute lesson plans, runs an interactive teaching session through the Reachy Mini SDK (speech, movement, and expressive behaviors), administers a five question quiz, grades responses against grounded rubrics, and emails a session summary while persisting progress for lesson continuation.

If you want a more provocative positioning for your audience: call it a “robotic learning OS” and explicitly state it is built around durable orchestration and stateful sessions rather than chat prompts, which is one of LangGraph’s core reasons to exist.
